## Introduction

It’s unusual for me to step outside cybersecurity or anything related to tech, but today I want to share one of my passion projects. I’m building an illustration agency, **BRIGHTVISION**, where we specialize in creating unique, memorable art that sparks curiosity and long-lasting impact.

We aim to bring a fresh perspective to a challenging industry.

**Why focus on building such an agency when hundreds already exist?** My answer lies in giving recognition to deserving artists, crafting art that resonates deeply with people and.... pieces they’ll remember for a long time.

## From Innovation to Imitation

But if you ask me on a deeper level the rise of AI art has reduced creativity to a mere tool where anyone thinks they can become Picasso by asking an AI to generate an image. But this misses a critical point. Those in the creative industry understand the challenges of solving complex visual communication problems. Revisions, budget cuts, and time constraints often stifle the true potential of talented artists.

Moreover, unethical practices in AI art, such as stealing artwork without compensating creators, are alarmingly widespread. While many choose to ignore this, it remains a harsh reality that countless artists face—struggling to defend their work in a world where many are underpaid and barely able to make ends meet. Why not recognize their creative efforts by fairly compensating the talent and skill that go into creating art?

Another concerning trend is the use of AI-generated art to produce cheap, subpar visuals for commercial purposes. I won’t name names, but many companies that can afford professional creative services opt for poorly executed AI art instead. It’s disrespectful to the craft, artists, and the audiences who engage with these visuals.

Take children’s books, for example. Seeing poorly illustrated, low-quality AI-generated images being published for children makes me sick. Children deserve better, and so do the creators who pour their hearts into their work.

## Closing thoughts

We truly believe that machines can’t solve visual problems—they can only assist humans in solving them. Incorporating human creativity into your design preserves its authenticity and fosters a deeper connection with those who experience it. People appreciate and recognize when genuine artistry is valued, creating meaningful and lasting impressions

AI-generated art in your product doesn’t reflect the quality or values your company stands for. If you’re looking for art that inspires and elevates your message, we’re here to help. We understand the importance of solving visual communication challenges and delivering work that stands out. By creating long-lasting art, we leave a long term impact on your customers.

**BRIGHTVISION** isn’t just about generating revenue or churning out generic drawings. It’s about enlightening business owners on the power of art and design as a means of communication to create genuine impact.
