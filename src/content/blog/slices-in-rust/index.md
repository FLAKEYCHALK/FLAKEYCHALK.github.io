## Overview

In Rust programming, a slice refers to a contiguous sequence of elements within a collection, like arrays or vectors. Slices enable borrowing a part of a collection without taking ownership, promoting efficient data manipulation. They can be created from arrays, vectors, strings, and other collections implementing the dereference trait in Rust.

## Code Example

In this code we have a variable called a and it holds an index of array containing `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and below that is another variable called slice. Here Iâ€™ll talk about how can you only get the part you need on the array without taking the ownership, so first you need to reference the &a and specify what part of the index you need to slice, in this code we only need `[2, 3]` .

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let slice = &a[1..3];

assert_eq!(slice, &[2,3]);
```

The only thing that makes beginner confuse is how the counting starts. In `&a[1..3]`; the counting starts from 1 until 2, and the 3 exclude it because we are accessing `[2, 3]`.

About the `assert_eq!` itâ€™s just to check you meet the slice in the variable `slice` you need to take, which is `[2, 3]`. The syntax for `assert_eq!` is shown below

```rust
assert_eq!(expected, actual);
```

There are some tips for using the slice

```rust
let slice = &x[..2];
// this is same here, since we are utilizing the short annotations here if you are using the first index
let slice = &x[0..2];
// if we can use it from the start of the index, then certainly we also have it for the last index
let slice = &x[0..];
// if you all want the entire index
let slice = &x[..];
```

And... That's it really... My quick opinion on how did I learn it!
